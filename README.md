# Research Data Management System
This repository contains the SQL scripts for a mock relational database to manage and analyze data from a research environment. The system tracks laboratories, researchers, projects, and experiments, providing a structured way to store and query scientific data.

## Features
Schema design: Labs, researchers, projects, experiments, and experiment results.

Sample data: Mock names, labs, projects, and metrics for testing queries.

Analysis queries: Project success rates, researcher contributions, project trends, and experiment outcomes.

## How to Run
1. Install SQL Server (2022 Developer Edition recommended).
2. Connect to your local SQL Server instance (e.g., `localhost`).
3. Open the `.sql` file in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another SQL client.
4. Run the script to create the schema and insert sample (or your own) data.
